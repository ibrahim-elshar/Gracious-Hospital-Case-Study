# Case Study For Gracious University Hospital


### IE 2088 Simulation Case Study

We review the case [A Prescription for Budget Woes at Gracious University Hospital](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/ited.2016.0159cs). First, we give an overview of the case. Then, we develop a simulation model using Python 3.6 and SymPy 1.4 and run several experiments which we base our recommendations on.

The main objective of the simulation is to come up with an automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs) restocking policy that allows serving as many patients as possible. We use an *(s, S) policy* as the restocking policy for the ADC. We report the (s, S) policy which strikes a good balance between all performance measures.
